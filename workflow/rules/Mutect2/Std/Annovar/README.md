The rule "annovar_on_mutect" likely involves running the ANNOVAR tool on the output generated by the MuTect variant calling tool.
- ANNOVAR is a popular software used for annotating genetic variants with various functional and genomic annotations. 
- MuTect, on the other hand, is a specific variant caller designed for detecting somatic mutations in tumor-normal paired samples.

The purpose of this rule is to annotate the variants called by MuTect using ANNOVAR, thereby providing additional functional and genomic information about the detected variants.
