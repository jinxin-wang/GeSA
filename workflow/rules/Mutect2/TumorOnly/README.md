### 1. Description of Mutect2 Tumor Only Submodule
The Mutect2 Tumor Only submodule is a component of the MuTect2 tool, which is used for somatic variant calling in tumor samples using next-generation sequencing data. The Tumor Only submodule specifically focuses on analyzing tumor-only sequencing data, where there is no corresponding normal sample available for comparison.

The purpose of the Mutect2 Tumor Only submodule is to identify somatic mutations, which are genetic alterations that are present only in the tumor cells and not in the normal cells. By analyzing the tumor sequencing data alone, the submodule aims to detect these somatic mutations and distinguish them from germline variants or sequencing artifacts.
