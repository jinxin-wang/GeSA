### 1. Description of Mutect2 Panel of Normals Submodule

The Mutect2 Panel of Normals (PoN) submodule is a component of the Mutect2 variant calling tool, which is commonly used for identifying somatic mutations in cancer genomic data. The PoN submodule specifically focuses on creating a Panel of Normals, which is a collection of normal sample data used as a reference to identify and filter out common germline variants or technical artifacts.

By incorporating the Mutect2 PoN submodule into the variant calling pipeline, it improves the accuracy and sensitivity of somatic mutation identification by reducing false-positive calls.
