### 1. Description of Mutect2 Panel of Normals Submodule

The Mutect2 Panel of Normals (PoN) submodule is a component of the Mutect2 variant calling tool, which is commonly used for identifying somatic mutations in cancer genomic data. The PoN submodule specifically focuses on creating a Panel of Normals, which is a collection of normal sample data used as a reference to identify and filter out common germline variants or technical artifacts.

By incorporating the Mutect2 PoN submodule into the variant calling pipeline, it improves the accuracy and sensitivity of somatic mutation identification by reducing false-positive calls.

The Mutect2 Panel of Normals (PoN) submodule in the context of exome sequencing (Exome) and split-read analysis (Split) refers to the application of Mutect2 variant calling tool for identifying somatic mutations in exome sequencing data using split-read analysis and constructing a Panel of Normals.

The purpose of the Mutect2 PoN submodule for Exome and Split analysis is to create a Panel of Normals that represents common germline variants and technical artifacts specific to exome sequencing data. This PoN is used as a reference to differentiate true somatic mutations from common germline variants or technical artifacts in the exome data.

### 2. Description of Interfaces and Dependencies

--> rule extract_exom_mutect2_pon

The "extract_exom_mutect2_pon" rule refers to a specific step in a genomic analysis pipeline that involves extracting the Panel of Normals (PoN) generated by the Mutect2 variant calling tool for exome sequencing data.

- Specifications of Input Files
the input file is a compressed VCF file that includes the PoN file generated by Mutect2 during the variant calling process. This PoN file contains variant information and filtering statistics for the common variants observed in the normal exome samples.
```
        Mutect2_vcf = "Mutect2_TvNp/{tsample}_Vs_{nsample}_PON_{panel_of_normal}_twicefiltered_TvNp.vcf.gz",
        Mutect2_vcf_index = "Mutect2_TvNp/{tsample}_Vs_{nsample}_PON_{panel_of_normal}_twicefiltered_TvNp.vcf.gz.tbi"
```
- Ouput Files

The rule generate a file that contains the extracted information from the PoN. This file is a variant call format (VCF) file. The extracted information may include variant positions, allele frequencies, filtering criteria, and other relevant details for the common variants observed in the normal exome samples.
```
        exom_Mutect2 = temp("Mutect2_TvNp_exom/{tsample}_Vs_{nsample}_PON_{panel_of_normal}_twicefiltered_TvNp_exom_unsorted.vcf.gz")
```
