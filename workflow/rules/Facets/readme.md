#### [major, minor allele and copy number](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/help/cnv/overview)

1. Minor Allele: the number of copies of the least frequent allele eg if ABB, minor allele = A ( 1 copy) and major allele = B ( 2 copies)
2. Copy Number: the sum of the major and minor allele counts eg if ABB, copy number = 3

#### [heterozygous mutation](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/heterozygous)

The presence of two different alleles at a particular gene locus. A heterozygous genotype may include one normal allele and one mutated allele or two different mutated alleles (compound heterozygote)
