### 1. Description of Fastqc Module
FastQC provides a simple way to do some quality checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses, which you can use to obtain an impression of whether your data has any problems that you should be aware of before moving on to the next analysis.
FastQC does the following:
- accepts FASTQ files (or BAM files) as input
- generates summary graphs and tables to help assess your data
- generates an easy-to-view HTML-based report with the graphs and tables

### 2. Description of Interfaces and Dependencies

- Specifications of Input Files

input files for the FastQC module is typically one or more FASTQ files . FASTQ file contains the high-throughtput sequencing data, and they contain the DNA sequence reads and their corresponding quality scores
- Ouput Files

- Genome Reference

- Packages and Versions
