### 1. Description of BQSR Module

the BQSR ( base quality socre recalibration ) is an important component for genomic data analysis , it detects systematic errors made by the sequencing machine when it estimates the accuracy of each base call .
The BQSR module aims to address these errors by recalibrating the base quality scores.
The recalibration process consist of two main steps:
First , the creation of a base quality score recalibration model and then the actual recalibration of base quality scores.
The model analyzes the characteristics of the sequenced data, such as the position in the read, the sequencing cycle, the sequence context, and other relevant features , Following that, it develops models of the patterns and error sources unique to the sequencing data. lastly , the recalibration model is applied to the entire dataset.
