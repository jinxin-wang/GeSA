## Introduction
GESA (**Ge**nome **S**equencing **A**nalysis Pipeline) is a workflow designed to detect variants in whole genome, whole exome, or targeted sequencing data, specifically for Human and Mouse samples. GESA can handle various scenarios including tumor-only, tumor/(matched/unmatched) normal, tumor/Panel of Normal (PoN), or tumor/(matched/unmatched) normal/PoN, as well as cell line data.

GESA was first prototyped by Ismael and Leonardo. Jinxin refactored the prototyped scripts and continued development alongside his colleagues Andrei and ???. Significant contributions have also been made by Jomar, [Andrei Ivashkin](https://github.com/andrrrsss), Yoann, and others.
