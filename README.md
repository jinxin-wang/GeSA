## Introduction
GESA (**Ge**nome **S**equencing **A**naysis Pipeline) is a workflow designed to detect variants on whole genome, whole exome or targeted sequencing data, designed for Human, and Mouse. 
GESA can handle tumor only, tumor/(matched/unmatched)normal, tumor/Panel of Normal, or tumor/(matched/unmatched)normal/PoN. Cell line 

GESA was first prototyped by [Ismael]() and maintained by [Leonardo](). [Jinxin]() refactored the prototype scripts and continued the developpement with his colleagues [Andrei]() and [???](). 
There are a lot of contributions from [Jomar](), [Andrei Ivashkin](https://github.com/andrrrsss), [Yoann](), [more]()
